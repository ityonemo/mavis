# Mavis version

## 0.0.1

initial push, with full functionality across most of elixir standard library

## 0.0.2

some touchup:
- remove lambda examples from tests
- add better support for aliased/composite builtins
- better intro documentation
- support for fictional `String.t/1` type; this will
  probably be pulled out into a plugin in the future.
